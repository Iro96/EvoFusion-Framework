## Abstract

This paper presents **EvoFusion**, a novel neural network training framework capable of self-evolving its architecture while learning from a variety of teacher models, regardless of differences in architecture, modality, or task domain.
- Unlike traditional knowledge distillation, which transfers weights or logits to a fixed student model, EvoFusion allows the student to dynamically mutate its structure—including the number of neurons, layers, activation functions, and connectivity—during training.
- The evolution is guided by a Meta-Controller that optimizes multiple objectives such as accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Special algorithms, including a Cross-Domain Knowledge Adapter, Function-Preserving Mutation Mechanism, and Multi-Objective Fitness Engine, enable effective learning without catastrophic forgetting.
- We demonstrate that EvoFusion is adaptable across domains, from large language models (LLMs) to computer vision architectures, and is capable of outperforming fixed-architecture students under resource constraints.

## Introduction

Traditional model distillation techniques assume fixed student architectures and matched modalities between teacher and student models. However, in real-world scenarios, teacher models can vary widely in architecture, size, and domain—from CNNs for vision, to Transformers for language, to hybrid multimodal models.

We propose EvoFusion, a self-evolving student model that:
1. Learns from any teacher (regardless of architecture or domain).
2. Mutates its architecture dynamically during training.
3. Preserves learned functions when expanding or modifying.
4. Balances multiple objectives through evolutionary search and RL-based decision-making.

This makes EvoFusion particularly suited for environments where:
- **The teacher model** is extremely large (e.g., GPT-4, ViT-G).
- **The student** must run under strict resource limits.
- **The architecture** search must happen online, during knowledge transfer.

## Related Work

- **Knowledge Distillation (KD)** — Hinton et al. introduced KD with soft targets, but architectures remained fixed.
- **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** — Works like ENAS and DARTS perform offline architecture search, requiring large computational budgets.
- **Function-Preserving Transformations** — Net2Net and MorphNet inspired methods for adding layers without retraining from scratch.
- **Cross-Modality Distillation** — Vision-Language alignment in CLIP shows how heterogeneous models can share embeddings.

EvoFusion integrates and extends these methods into a unified, dynamic training loop.

## EvoFusion Framework Overview

**EvoFusion** consists of four **main modules**:
- **Cross-Domain Knowledge Adapter (CDKA)** - Maps teacher outputs/features to the student’s space using projection networks or alignment losses.
- **Meta-Controller for Architecture Evolution (MCAE)** - A reinforcement learning or evolutionary search controller that decides architecture mutations.
- **Function-Preserving Mutation Mechanism (FPMM)** - Ensures structural changes keep prior knowledge intact.
- **Multi-Objective Fitness Engine (MOFE)** - Scores candidate architectures based on accuracy, parameter count, inference latency, and transferability.

## Risks & Mitigation

| **Risk**                | **Mitigation**                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Model bloat             | Add parameter penalty to fitness function |
| Catastrophic forgetting | Function-preserving mutations             |
| Overfitting to teacher  | Mix teacher distillation with real labels |
| High compute cost       | Early stopping + population pruning       |

## Usage & Applications

- Resource-Constrained Deployment: Mobile/IoT devices learning from cloud-scale teachers.
- Cross-Modal Transfer: Vision teacher → language student.
- Model Compression with Growth: Opposite of pruning — start small and grow only as needed.
- Automated ML Education: Teaching basic networks to evolve into task experts.

## Support & Deployment

- API: Python library for integrating custom teachers/students.
- CLI Tool: For running experiments and logging results.
- Plugins: Mutation strategies, fitness metrics, visualization tools.
- Visualization: Real-time architecture growth charts.
